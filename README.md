# USE AT YOUR OWN RISK

## This repo is no longer maintained - I lost access to Membean when I left high school

Fully functional Membean bot. Simply copy and paste into the inspector window and off you go! Made completely with JavaScript. The most recent version is posted on the main branch (this one) and past versions are on their own separate branches. Beta versions are new, but have not been fully tested and may have bugs.

## Operating the Bot
- Open the inspector window (ctrl + shift + I for most devices)
- Select "Console" in the bar at the top of the inspector window
- Copy and paste whichever version you choose into the inspector window and press enter
- Depending on when you start the bot, you may miss the first 1-2 questions

## Version - Current: 2.0
- Version 3 is currently in beta
  - New look
  - Creates a log of all new words
  - Hides controls to prevent detection by the teacher
  - Choose to skip new words
  - Complete rework to the structure of the code
